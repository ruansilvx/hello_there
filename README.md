# Hello there app

This Flutter application features an interactive and visually appealing color-changing animation. 
When the user taps anywhere on the screen, a circle expands from the tap point to cover the entire 
screen, changing the background color. Simultaneously, the center text spins during the animation, 
creating a dynamic visual effect.

## Features

- **Random Color Generation**: Generates a new random color on each tap.
- **Smooth Color Transition**: Utilizes an ease-in-out curve for smoother color transitions.
- **Animated Text**: The center text rotates while the color transition occurs.
